            Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            We're excited that you're here to participate in our event. Whether you're a coding novice or an experienced
            developer, this hackathon is designed to provide you with an engaging and challenging experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The objective for you in this hackathon is to build an equity trading algorithm that maximizes profit by
            buying and selling stocks (i.e., manage an investment portfolio).  You will be provided access to years of
            historical data for a group of 500 stocks. Your algorithm should step through the data, one day at a time,
            and for each day, generate orders to buy or sell each of the 500 stocks.
            You can work individually or form a team to work together.
            Best of luck with your projects! We can't wait to see what you come up with!
        </p>

            About The Data
        </h2>
        <p>
            Please email to <strong style="color:blue">airsyntheticdata.requests@jpmorgan.com</strong> to request the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data for this hackathon is a synthetic version of the S&P 500, created by AI Research's Synthetic Data group.
            It is intended to be a synthetic version of the market that can be used for testing trading algorithms.
            It is modeled after real data, with accurate similarities and correlations between groups of stocks.

            The data that traders use to inform their trading is classified as "financial data" or "market data."
            Financial data includes information related to a company's financial health, industry, and macroeconomic factors,
            while market data focuses on historical price and volume information.
            Traders analyze these types of data to make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.
        </p>
        <h3>Market Data</h3>
        <p>
            The market data for this project is provided as a comma-separated-values (CSV) file,
            where each row represents the data for one day. An example looks like this:

        <h3>Financial Data</h3>
        <p>
            The financial data used by traders for investing generally falls into four categories:
            Fundamental, Technical, Sentiment, and Macroeconomic:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fundamental Analysis:</b> This approach involves evaluating a company's financial health,
                competitive position, and overall economic environment.</li>
            <li><b>Technical Analysis:</b> This approach involves analyzing historical price and volume data
                to identify patterns and trends suggesting future price movements.</li>
            <li><b>Market Sentiment:</b> Stock traders analyze market sentiment data, such as investor surveys,
                put-call ratios, and short interest, to gauge investor sentiment and identify potential
                contrarian trading opportunities. News feeds may also provide sentiment information.</li>
            <li><b>Macroeconomic Indicators:</b> Stock traders consider the overall economic environment by
                analyzing GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and employment figures to identify how
                these factors may impact a company's performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To simplify the project, we will precompute the values for five indicators and provide them to
            participants for each stock in a CSV file named for that stock. For instance, the file providing
            information about IBM is named IBM.CSV, and it looks like this:

            We will provide a market simulator, that will read in your trades file, and the market data file,
            then simulate your trades. It will provide some metrics of your trading performance, and charts showing how it did.
            We will evaluate each algorithm according to <b>Sharpe ratio</b>, and <b>total return</b>,
            and provide awards and rankings on each of those metrics.

        <p>
            Participants will be provided with 20 folders of data. The folders are in two groups: "training” and "testing”,
            e.g., training01 to training10 and testing01 to testing10. Participants can use the data in the training folders
            to train or develop trading algorithms. Each folder will contain about 501 files (1 market and 500 financial data).
            The data in each folder covers the same period, from January 2022 to December 2022.

            Participants' algorithms must follow these rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No peeking into the future -- the algorithm should step through the data daily and make trading
                decisions only on the data up to and including that day. It should not, for instance, look ahead to a
                future price to make a trade in anticipation of that future price.</li>
            <li>If the trading algorithm is learning or adaptive, the participant should reset it before running it
                on each test set. For instance, the algorithm should not learn from data in testing01 in anticipation
                of running on data in testing02.</li>
            <li>Deterministic -- given the same data, the algorithm should always output the same trades. Participants
                can use a random number generator, which should be initialized with the same seed each time.</li>
            <li>Use of data -- participants should NOT allow their trading algorithms to look at the data in the testing
                folders until the trading strategies or algorithms have been finalized.</li>
            <li>If participants choose to revise or improve the trading algorithm, for instance, by learning or retraining,
                they should ONLY use the training data for that purpose. Participants should never train on the testing data.</li>
            <li>Participants should run the same trading algorithm on all the testing data.
                Don't optimize trading algorithms for each folder.</li>
        </ul>
